node-engage
===========

This is a node.js library for interacting with the Silverpop Engage API. It is not an exhaustive implementation of the Engage API. Rather, it provides an extensible base for implementing API method functionality, and it is intended to give potential Engage API developers a good starting place for their Node.js projects. This project is maintained by engineers from the Silverpop Custom Integration Services department in our spare time, and other developers are welcome to fork new versions.

Please note: the Silverpop Engage API is only available to current customers and partners of Silverpop, an IBM Company, who have active Engage licenses. If you are not a current customer, this project will probably not be useful to you.
